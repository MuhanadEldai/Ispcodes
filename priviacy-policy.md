Privacy Policy for ISP Codes
Effective Date: 2025-02-14
Last Updated: 2025-05-09

1. Introduction

ISP Codes provides a mobile application that displays ISP subscription codes for MTN, Zain, and Sudani users. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user information.

2. Information We Collect

We do not collect, store, or share personally identifiable information (PII). However, we use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send push notifications. FCM may collect device-related identifiers (e.g., device tokens) for the purpose of delivering notifications.

The app may also fetch a JSON file hosted on GitHub to update ISP code data. This operation is read-only and does not involve collecting user data.

3. Permissions Used

The app may request the following permissions for proper functionality:

Phone Dialer – To allow users to directly dial ISP codes.


We do not access, store, or transmit any personal data through these permissions.

4. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:

Firebase Cloud Messaging (Google LLC) – For sending push notifications. See Google’s Privacy Policy.

GitHub (Microsoft Corporation) – To host a publicly accessible JSON file containing ISP codes. No user data is sent or received in this process.


Please note that if you download updates from sources like the Google Play Store, those services may have their own privacy policies.

5. Data Security

As we do not store personal data, there is minimal risk of unauthorized data access. We rely on trusted third-party services that implement industry-standard security practices.

6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Changes will be posted on this page. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
