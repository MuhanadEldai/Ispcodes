# Privacy Policy for ISP Codes  
**Effective Date:** 2025-02-14  
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-11  

## Introduction

ISP Codes provides a mobile application that displays ISP subscription codes for MTN, Zain, and Sudani users. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user information.

## Information We Collect

We do not collect, store, or share personally identifiable information (PII). However, we use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send push notifications. FCM may collect device-related identifiers (e.g., device tokens) for the purpose of delivering notifications.

The app may also fetch a JSON file hosted on GitHub to update ISP code data. This operation is read-only and does not involve collecting user data.

## Permissions Used

The app may request the following permissions for proper functionality:

- **Phone Dialer** – To allow users to directly dial ISP codes.

We do not access, store, or transmit any personal data through these permissions.

## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:

- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (Google LLC)** – For sending push notifications. See [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **GitHub (Microsoft Corporation)** – To host a publicly accessible JSON file containing ISP codes. No user data is sent or received in this process.

Please note that if you download updates from sources like the Google Play Store, those services may have their own privacy policies.

## Advertising

We use **Google AdMob** to serve ads in our application. AdMob may collect and use data such as:

- Advertising ID
- Device information (e.g., model, OS version)
- App usage data

This data is used for ad personalization, analytics, and to limit ad frequency. You can learn more about how Google uses this information at:  
[https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)

Users can opt out of personalized ads through their device settings by selecting “Opt out of Ads Personalization.”

## Data Security

As we do not store personal data, there is minimal risk of unauthorized data access. We rely on trusted third-party services that implement industry-standard security practices.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Changes will be posted on this page. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
